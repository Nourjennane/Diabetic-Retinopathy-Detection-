# Diabetic Retinopathy Detection

This project focuses on detecting **Diabetic Retinopathy** from retina images using machine learning techniques. It is based on a Jupyter Notebook (`diabetic-retinopathy-6.ipynb`) that covers data preprocessing, model building, training, and evaluation.

## Project Structure

- **Data Preparation**
  - Loading and inspecting retinal image data.
  - Preprocessing images (resizing, normalization, augmentation).
  - Handling class imbalance if necessary.

- **Model Development**
  - Building a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) using TensorFlow/Keras.
  - Setting up training parameters, optimizers, and loss functions.
  - Applying data augmentation strategies to improve generalization.

- **Training and Evaluation**
  - Training the CNN on the processed dataset.
  - Evaluating model performance with metrics such as accuracy and confusion matrix.
  - Visualizing training and validation curves.

- **Prediction**
  - Generating predictions on test or validation sets.
  - (Optional) Saving the trained model for future use.

## Requirements

- Python 3.7+
- Jupyter Notebook
- Install the necessary libraries:

```bash
pip install tensorflow keras numpy pandas matplotlib scikit-learn
