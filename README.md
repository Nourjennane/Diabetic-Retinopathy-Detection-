# 🩺 Diabetic Retinopathy Detection

Welcome!  
This project is about teaching a computer to spot signs of **Diabetic Retinopathy** 🧿 — a serious eye disease — by looking at retinal images.  
(Yes, we’re giving machines a little bit of doctor superpowers. 🦸‍♂️)

Built around the notebook `diabetic-retinopathy-6.ipynb`, this repo walks through the full journey: from raw images ➡️ preprocessing ➡️ model building ➡️ training ➡️ evaluation ➡️ (optional) saving your model.

## 🚀 Project Highlights

- **Data Preparation** 📂  
  - Load retina images.
  - Resize, normalize, and augment them.
  - Deal with class imbalance like a pro.

- **Model Development** 🛠️  
  - Design a CNN (Convolutional Neural Network) using TensorFlow/Keras.
  - Tune hyperparameters like a master chef. 👨‍🍳

- **Training & Evaluation** 🎯  
  - Train the model and track performance.
  - Visualize accuracy and loss curves (hello, pretty graphs 📈).
  - Check confusion matrices to see where the model trips.

- **Prediction** 🔮  
  - Use the model to predict unseen images.
  - (Optional) Save your trained model for later superhero missions.
